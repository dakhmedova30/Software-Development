DISCO:
 * readlines() returns a list that contains each line in the file as a separate list item.
 * requests.get() allows you to make a request to a webpage; it sends a GET request to the url.
 * json.loads() allows you to read a json file like a dictionary; parses a JSON string and converts it into a Python dictionary.

QCC:
 * Is there a way to read the fields of the JSON file?
